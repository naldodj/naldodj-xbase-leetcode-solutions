    19. Remove Nth Node From End of List

    Given the head of a linked list, remove the nth node from the end of the list and return its head.

    Example 1:
    Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], n = 2
    Output: [1,2,3,5]

    Example 2:
    Input: head = [1], n = 1
    Output: []

    Example 3:
    Input: head = [1,2], n = 1
    Output: [1]

    Constraints:

    The number of nodes in the list is sz.
    1 <= sz <= 30
    0 <= Node.val <= 100
    1 <= n <= sz
