    20. Valid Parentheses

    Given a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.

    An input string is valid if:

    Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
    Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
    Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.

    Example 1:
    Input: s = "()"
    Output: true

    Example 2:
    Input: s = "()[]{}"
    Output: true

    Example 3:
    Input: s = "(]"

    Output: false

    Example 4:
    Input: s = "([])"

    Output: true

    Constraints:

    1 <= s.length <= 104
    s consists of parentheses only '()[]{}'.
