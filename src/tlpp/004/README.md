# [Median of Two Sorted Arrays](https://leetcode.com/problems/median-of-two-sorted-arrays/)

    4. Median of Two Sorted Arrays

    Given two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively, return the median of the two sorted arrays.

    The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).

    Example 1:

    Input: nums1 = [1,3], nums2 = [2]
    Output: 2.00000
    Explanation: merged array = [1,2,3] and median is 2.

    Example 2:

    Input: nums1 = [1,2], nums2 = [3,4]
    Output: 2.50000
    Explanation: merged array = [1,2,3,4] and median is (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5.

    Constraints:

    nums1.length == m
    nums2.length == n
    0 <= m <= 1000
    0 <= n <= 1000
    1 <= m + n <= 2000
    -106 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 106
