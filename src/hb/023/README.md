# [Merge k Sorted Lists](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-k-sorted-lists/description/)

    23. Merge k Sorted Lists

    You are given an array of k linked-lists lists, each linked-list is sorted in ascending order.

    Merge all the linked-lists into one sorted linked-list and return it.

    Example 1:
    Input: lists = [[1,4,5],[1,3,4],[2,6]]
    Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4,5,6]
    Explanation: The linked-lists are:
    [
      1->4->5,
      1->3->4,
      2->6
    ]
    merging them into one sorted list:
    1->1->2->3->4->4->5->6

    Example 2:
    Input: lists = []
    Output: []

    Example 3:
    Input: lists = [[]]
    Output: []

    Constraints:
    k == lists.length
    0 <= k <= 10^4
    0 <= lists[i].length <= 500
    -10^4 <= lists[i][j] <= 10^4
    lists[i] is sorted in ascending order.
    The sum of lists[i].length will not exceed 10^4.
